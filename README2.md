The two configurations you provided define Docker networks in a Docker Compose file, but they serve different purposes:

Defining a Custom Bridge Network:


networks:
  my_custom_bridge_network:
    driver: bridge
This configuration defines a custom bridge network named my_custom_bridge_network. This network will be created internally by Docker Compose and will only be accessible to services defined within the same docker-compose.yml file.

Using an External Network:


networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: my_custom_bridge_network
This configuration specifies that the service(s) defined in the Docker Compose file should use an external network named my_custom_bridge_network. This network is expected to be created outside of Docker Compose, and the services will connect to it. The external keyword indicates that the network is not managed by Docker Compose and already exists in the Docker environment.

In summary:

The first configuration creates an internal custom bridge network specifically for use within the Docker Compose project.
The second configuration references an external network that already exists in the Docker environment and allows services in the Docker Compose project to connect to it.
